CustomMouseGestures
===================

My favorite mouse gestures made in autohotkey.
The windows for the following process names are excluded: KSP.exe (Kerbal Space Program) and mstsc.exe (Remote Desktop)
Right mouse button starts the gesture:
- Down-Right: Close tab in firefox or close application window
- Down-Left: Restore tab in firefox
- Up-Right: Switch to the next tab in firefox
- Up-Left: Switch to the previous tab in firefox
- Right-Up: Duplicate current tab in firefox
- Down-Up: Reload current tab in firefox

Holding the right mouse button and scrolling up or down will scroll 6 times faster than normal. Also as soon you scroll while holding the right mouse button will abort any guesture.

Also some hotkeys, that move and resize the active window to the...
- Win + Ins = top left of the screen
- Win + Home = top half of the screen
- Win + PageUp = top right of the screen
- Win + PageDown = bottom right of the screen
- Win + End = bottom half of the screen
- Win + Del = bottom left of the screen
